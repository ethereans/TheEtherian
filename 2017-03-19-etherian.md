- [WeTrust Crowdsale Update](https://medium.com/wetrust-blog/eth-and-btc-contribution-dcd16876bf28#.ietwt4sqs)
    - Some users still unhappy with response and their contributions not being calculated at the same rate as WeTrust
    > > "First day participants were priced at BTC, WT team gets 20MM coins get priced at ICO close date, or vesting schedule, who knows. Pegging to BTC and distribution method was not announced until 15 days into the ICO (sort of like taking an option on ETH @ron). 91.7% (304) of ethereum investors participated on day one and have collectively lost about $1,493,326 due to ETH increase. If you assume worse case for BTC participants have benefitted about $64,032 due to BTC price decrease. 71% of participants contributed Ether representing 80.7% of the total value so far in USD terms. And if you believe that hiring developers will ultimately require fiat it’s a windfall of $1.5MM for WeTrust from day one investors." - @ncavet, WeTrust investor
