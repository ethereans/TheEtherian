- >Vitalik Buterin: the idea for login/logout is that there are many validators who will not be able to validate 24/7, but rather want the ability to "go to sleep" for some period of time. During this time they would not contribute to the total validator set.
- >Vitalik Buterin: I'd rather be as hobbyist-friendly as possible personally. ie. I want to able to validate with a bunch of my ether from my laptop whenever I'm online. It's only a medium amount of added complexity as it turns out and it's a powerful feature.
- Sequence numbers do not work for replay protection, they lead to "weird corner cases where an attacker equivocates." 
- On controlling the number of validators:
    >Vitalik Buterin: So, right now, validators do have to pay for gas for all the messages that they send and I have a pet theory that this may be all that is necessary to keep the number of validators under control.
- [Casper Standup 01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZxnR_Dx3FE)
- [Paper reccomended by Loi](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/307.pdf)--"Practical Synchronous Byzantine Consensus"
- >Vitalik Buterin: So, a few updates from my side. 1. finished implementing the version of the viper contract that uses bit masks, seems to work fine. Prepares take ~94k gas [editors note: down to 87k], there's probably room for a bit of optimization there. Commits are ~84k gas[editors note: down to 79k].

- [KC Chng's thoughts on private permissioned blockchains](https://dgx-public.slack.com/archives/C0HEF2N1H/p1492040004983464)
- Observation from Darvin @ REIDAO:
    >DGD is the least risky "coin" there is. The ETH is still there, and won't be taken out unless the holders agree to it. What more do you want? At least there is a face value to DGD. Can't say the same with ALL the other "ICO"s.

- Blog Post: [Welcome to the FirstBlood Alpha!](https://blog.firstblood.io/firstblood-alpha-42c8eec2423f)
- FirstBlood opens alpha to first group of pre-sale participants!
- >auryn_macmillan: The pre-alpha highlighted some major UX issues. So in the short term, we've made a compromise on decentralisation in favour of making an amazing UX. But the goal in the medium-long term is to tend towards decentralisation as both our and ethereum's technology matures.
- It will be a while before LoL makes it into the beta.
- The team plans on using Twitch as a major tool in its marketing strategy.
- The alpha will be opened up to the larger 'early community' shortly.

## [Giveth](http://www.giveth.io/) - Crowd Funded Donation Dapp[![Join the chat at http://slack.giveth.io/](https://i1.wp.com/theetherian.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/slack_mark_web.png?ssl=1&w=50)](https://slack.giveth.io/)|[![Check out the github at https://github.com/Giveth](https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com/images/icons/emoji/octocat.png)](https://github.com/Giveth)
- >[Griff Green] -Our decentralized team is expanding 3 new developers have joined the team.
  -@jbaylina and I are nearly done with reworking our Vault contract, adding extra security features by pairing it with a Vault Controller. 
-@adriamb and @daniphilia have integrated truffle, travis, solcover & codecov.io to our smart contract testing framework. We are able to see automatically if changes in the code are covered in tests or not. I think this will be the first project doing this with smartcontacts. A small demo here: https://github.com/adriamb/vaultcontract
-@jsteele has been attacking our MVP DApp, getting it ready for other open source projects to beta test receiving donations.

[![Join the chat at https://chat.makerdao.com/channel/general](https://theetherian.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/chat-icon.png?ssl=1&w=50)](https://chat.makerdao.com/channel/general)  
- Simple Stable Coin SAI soon to be released in Alpha
    - SAI (simple dai) is a CDP engine that supports a single collateral type and uses a special model for claiming the collateral which makes the system more simple and have higher liquidity, but also more reliant on the price feeds
    - it uses an asset called SKR to represent claims to the collateral in the event of a global settlement (so it isnt like MKR at all)
    - it will be possible to stop SAI at any time, in the event of a security issue or for other reasons, and then all SAI holders will be able to claim ETH directly at face value (unless the system is undercollateralized, in which case they get a haircut), and the leftover collateral goes to the CDP holders
    - SKR is received when one deposits ETH into the system and can be used as collateral
- Planning a marketing push soon

- [Q1 Update](https://blog.ujomusic.com/q1-update-the-mvp-collaborating-towards-an-open-music-industry-infrastructure-25f3ac79a933#.78zh4z521)
- Pivoting architecture to be more inclusive of peers (uPort and others) who share the vision for an open music industry.
- Drafting experimental designs in using tokenized models:
    - fostering standards-compliant metadata (eg [COALA IP](https://github.com/COALAIP/specs))
    - sharing said metadata (into IPFS/IPDB/Mediachain/Swarm)
    - making sure to re-use and define what is valid metadata
- Exploring concepts such as [continuous token models](https://medium.com/@simondlr/exploring-continuous-token-models-towards-a-million-networks-of-value-fff153175776%20) and [curation communities](https://medium.com/@simondlr/a-bonded-curation-community-247f14a6de04#.bx59swd45%20) with experiments rolling out soon!

- For devs: Keep in mind that uPort pays the gas fees for transactions done with your uPort identity. 
- >Christian Lundkvist: Yes we are currently investigating private testnet support for some specific uses. Not clear at this point when it will be widely available.
- >Christian Lundkvist: Yes it [uPort] works right now in the mobile browser. Instead of showing you a qr code it will switch to the uport app and show you the transaction card.
