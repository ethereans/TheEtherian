##### [Augur](https://augur.net/) – Prediction Market
- Another great blog: [Augur Development Update – MAY 10TH](http://blog.augur.net/augur-development-update-may-10th/)
- > micah: "Augur is trying to make REP have _real_ value and not be a rent-seeking token like so many others.  Rent seeking tokens have a reasonable expectation of crashing eventually as they are not sustainable (basically an advanced Ponzi scheme)".
- Ethereums future upgrade to Metropolis should have no substantial effect on augur.

- [Casper Research Meeting #4 (Video Recording)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bWL5UyniMc)
- A discussion (between Vitalik and Jacob) on an attack vector involving 34% of validators going offline simultaneosly prompted Vitalik to say he may be more comfortable with "higher vlad-style penalties for non-participating validators." 
- Vitalik Buterin: "Personally, at this point I am happy that it satisfies the BFT properties that we want it to satisfy, as we do kinda have formal proofs for that, but getting all the game theory right is definitely the next and harder frontier."
- [Post worth reading](http://pasteboard.co/6qDo9PZqM.png) from Jacob Eliosoff on the 34% attack vector. Waiting on responses.

    - >[Martin Köppelmann]we are currently again in Gibraltar at [Digital Currency Summit](https://digitalcurrencysumm.it/dcs-gibraltar-blockchain-regulatory-framework/) Gibraltar will introduce today a regulatory framework (like the NY bitlicence) but MUCH MUCH more businiess friendly. We have been involved early in giving feedback to those documents. We are in close contact with regulators here and we believe it can be a big advantage for Gnosis for creating partnerships with other entities if we have more legal certainty.
