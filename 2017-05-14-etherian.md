##### [Augur](https://augur.net/) – Prediction Market
- Another great blog: [Augur Development Update – MAY 10TH](http://blog.augur.net/augur-development-update-may-10th/)
- > micah: "Augur is trying to make REP have _real_ value and not be a rent-seeking token like so many others.  Rent seeking tokens have a reasonable expectation of crashing eventually as they are not sustainable (basically an advanced Ponzi scheme)".
- Ethereums future upgrade to Metropolis should have no substantial effect on augur.
